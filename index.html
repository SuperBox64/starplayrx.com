            <h2>Official Statement</h2>
            <div class="legal-content">
                <p><strong>NOTICE OF DISCONTINUATION:</strong> As of March 17, 2025, StarPlayrX is no longer available for download on the Apple App Store. This action follows the receipt of a formal cease and desist communication from SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>It is with profound regret that we must inform our valued users of this development. StarPlayrX was developed with the primary objective of providing an accessible alternative interface for legitimate SiriusXM subscribers, with particular emphasis on enhancing the user experience for visually impaired individuals.</p>
                
                <p>We hereby affirm that at all material times, StarPlayrX operated solely as an alternative interface and required users to maintain valid and paid SiriusXM satellite radio subscriptions for functionality. No subscription content was ever provided by StarPlayrX independent of the user's existing SiriusXM account credentials.</p>
                
                <p>The aforementioned application has served thousands of users for several years without prior objection from SiriusXM Holdings Inc., making the timing and nature of this action particularly unfortunate for our user community.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Accessibility Commitment</h2>
            <div class="legal-content">
                <p>StarPlayrX was conceived, designed, and developed with substantial input from visually impaired beta testers. The application's primary distinguishing feature was its enhanced accessibility framework, which provided superior navigation and content consumption capabilities compared to the official application.</p>
                
                <p>For nearly a decade, StarPlayrX has faithfully served the visually impaired community, providing an accessible alternative that has become an essential daily tool for thousands of blind and low-vision users seeking to enjoy SiriusXM content.</p>
                
                <ul class="accessibility-features">
                    <li><strong>100% Voice Over Supported</strong> - Complete integration with Apple's VoiceOver technology throughout the entire app</li>
                    <li><strong>Stars/Favorites Support</strong> - Fully accessible favorites system with proper labeling for screen readers</li>
                    <li><strong>Channel Guide</strong> - Voice-navigable guide with comprehensive audio descriptions</li>
                    <li><strong>Categories</strong> - Accessible category navigation with semantic grouping</li>
                    <li><strong>Channels</strong> - Enhanced channel descriptions for non-visual users</li>
                    <li><strong>What's Playing</strong> - Real-time audio announcements of current content</li>
                    <li><strong>Magic Tap</strong> - Support for VoiceOver's Magic Tap gesture for quick access to common functions</li>
                    <li><strong>Play/Pause</strong> - Accessible media controls with proper labeling</li>
                    <li><strong>Siri Controls</strong> - Play and pause StarPlayrX directly using Siri commands</li>
                    <li><strong>Siri Volume</strong> - Adjust volume levels using voice commands through Siri</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We contend that the removal of StarPlayrX represents a material reduction in the availability of accessible media consumption options for this demographic of SiriusXM subscribers.</p>

            <h2>Legal</h2>
            <div class="legal-content">
                <p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> StarPlayrX required a valid SiriusXM satellite radio subscription for operation, we maintain that no infringement of intellectual property or contractual rights occurred during the application's operational period.</p>
                
                <p><strong>FURTHERMORE:</strong> We note that SiriusXM Holdings Inc., the parent company that prompted this removal, permits third-party developers to create applications utilizing the Pandora API, a service also owned by SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p><strong>TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF REMOVAL:</strong> Upon forensic analysis, we have determined that SiriusXM implemented a server-side restriction specifically targeting StarPlayrX by analyzing and filtering requests based on application-identifying metadata. This implementation appears to have been derived from an examination of StarPlayrX's publicly available source code. This technical approach effectively prevented the application from functioning without requiring its removal from users' devices, demonstrating a targeted action rather than a general security protocol.</p>
                
                <p><strong>CONSEQUENTLY:</strong> The differential treatment between these platforms appears inconsistent with industry standards and potentially contrary to the interests of subscribers with accessibility requirements. The targeted technical measures implemented specifically against StarPlayrX demonstrate a calculated effort to restrict third-party accessibility solutions rather than a general security or compliance policy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS:</strong> It is noteworthy that SiriusXM directed legal resources toward the independent sole developer of StarPlayrX despite no demonstrable financial harm to their organization. All users of StarPlayrX were required to maintain valid paid SiriusXM subscriptions, thereby preserving SiriusXM's revenue stream while potentially increasing subscriber retention through enhanced accessibility options.</p>
                
                <p><strong>CORPORATE BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT:</strong> This situation illustrates a concerning pattern wherein a multi-billion dollar corporation utilizes its substantial legal resources against independent developers — "the little guy" — rather than engaging in constructive dialogue. We express our sincere gratitude to SiriusXM for demonstrating with such clarity the true nature of their corporate values and their stance toward the accessibility community. Such transparency, albeit unintentional, provides valuable insight to consumers regarding their choice of service providers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE:</strong> In compliance with the received communication, StarPlayrX is no longer available for download, and existing installations may cease to function properly as server-side changes are implemented by SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>We encourage SiriusXM subscribers to express their concerns to SiriusXM Holdings Inc. regarding their selective enforcement against independent developers while permitting corporate third-party access through platforms like Pandora.</p>
                
                <p>The source code for StarPlayrX remains available for educational, research, and accessibility advancement purposes via GitHub, in accordance with applicable fair use doctrines and for the promotion of digital inclusion and accessibility technologies.</p>

            <p>SiriusXM's actions against StarPlayrX raise significant questions about their commitment to the visually impaired community.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that SiriusXM's official mobile applications continue to present considerable accessibility barriers for visually impaired users, including inadequate VoiceOver implementation and navigation challenges that substantially limit usability.</p>

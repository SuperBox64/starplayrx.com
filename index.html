                <p><strong>NOTICE OF DISCONTINUATION:</strong> As of May 23, 2024, StarPlayrX is no longer available for download on the Apple App Store. This action follows the receipt of a formal cease and desist communication from SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>It is with profound regret that we must inform our valued users of this development. StarPlayrX was developed with the primary objective of providing an accessible alternative interface for legitimate SiriusXM subscribers, with particular emphasis on enhancing the user experience for visually impaired individuals.</p>
                
                <p>We hereby affirm that at all material times, StarPlayrX operated solely as an alternative interface and required users to maintain valid and paid SiriusXM satellite radio subscriptions for functionality. No subscription content was ever provided by StarPlayrX independent of the user's existing SiriusXM account credentials.</p>
                
                <p>The aforementioned application has served thousands of users for several years without prior objection from SiriusXM Holdings Inc., making the timing and nature of this action particularly unfortunate for our user community.</p>

                        <p>StarPlayrX was conceived, designed, and developed with substantial input from visually impaired beta testers.

                        <p>Statistical data indicates that a significant percentage of our user base consisted of individuals with visual impairments or other accessibility requirements that were otherwise inadequately addressed by the official application.</p>
                        
                        <p>We contend that the removal of StarPlayrX represents a material reduction in the availability of accessible media consumption options for this demographic of SiriusXM subscribers.</p>

            <div class="legal-content">
                <p>StarPlayrX was designed from the ground up with robust VoiceOver compatibility, ensuring visually impaired users could navigate and enjoy SiriusXM content with unprecedented ease. Our application offered the following accessibility enhancements:</p>
                
                <div class="feature-grid">
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h3>Favorites Management</h3>
                        <p>Fully voice-navigable favorites system with custom grouping options allowing users to organize channels by category, frequency of use, or personal preference. Each favorite was properly labeled for screen readers with descriptive, accessible announcements.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h3>Enhanced Search</h3>
                        <p>Voice-guided search functionality with intelligent results grouping and navigation. Search history was maintained and accessible via VoiceOver, with contextual cues for easier navigation through search results.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="feature-item">

                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h3>Custom Groupings</h3>
                        <p>User-defined custom groupings that retained accessibility context when rearranged. Each group had enhanced accessibility labels that provided additional information about contained channels.</p>

                    <div class="feature-item">

                        <p>Simplified gesture controls designed specifically for non-visual use, allowing blind users to navigate content with consistent, predictable touch patterns that were thoroughly announced by VoiceOver.</p>

                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h3>Audio Descriptions</h3>
                        <p>Enhanced audio descriptions for non-textual elements and channel artwork, ensuring users received complete information about graphical elements and station identities through their screen readers.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>These accessibility features were developed with ongoing feedback from our visually impaired beta testers, resulting in an interface that was not only technically compatible with screen readers but truly optimized for non-visual interaction.</p>

            <h2>Legal Information</h2>
            <div class="legal-content">
                <p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> StarPlayrX required a valid SiriusXM satellite radio subscription for operation, we maintain that no infringement of intellectual property or contractual rights occurred during the application's operational period.</p>
                
                <p><strong>FURTHERMORE:</strong> We note that SiriusXM Holdings Inc., the parent company that prompted this removal, permits third-party developers to create applications utilizing the Pandora API, a service also owned by SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p><strong>TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF REMOVAL:</strong> It has come to our attention that SiriusXM implemented a technical restriction specifically targeting StarPlayrX through user agent identification. This method involves server-side filtering that rejects API requests originating from the StarPlayrX application by examining the user agent string that identifies our software. This approach effectively disabled the application's functionality without requiring its removal from users' devices.</p>
                
                <p><strong>CONSEQUENTLY:</strong> The differential treatment between these platforms appears inconsistent with industry standards and potentially contrary to the interests of subscribers with accessibility requirements. The targeted technical measures implemented specifically against StarPlayrX demonstrate a calculated effort to restrict third-party accessibility solutions rather than a general security or compliance policy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE:</strong> In compliance with the received communication, StarPlayrX is no longer available for download, and existing installations may cease to function properly as server-side changes are implemented by SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>Users seeking alternative accessible media options are encouraged to communicate their accessibility requirements directly to SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>The source code for StarPlayrX remains available for educational and research purposes via GitHub, in accordance with applicable fair use doctrines and for the advancement of accessibility technologies.</p>

                <p><strong>NOTICE OF DISCONTINUATION:</strong> As of May 23, 2024, StarPlayrX is no longer available for download on the Apple App Store. This action follows the receipt of a formal cease and desist communication from SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>It is with profound regret that we must inform our valued users of this development. StarPlayrX was developed with the primary objective of providing an accessible alternative interface for legitimate SiriusXM subscribers, with particular emphasis on enhancing the user experience for visually impaired individuals.</p>
                
                <p>We hereby affirm that at all material times, StarPlayrX operated solely as an alternative interface and required users to maintain valid and paid SiriusXM satellite radio subscriptions for functionality. No subscription content was ever provided by StarPlayrX independent of the user's existing SiriusXM account credentials.</p>
                
                <p>The aforementioned application has served thousands of users for several years without prior objection from SiriusXM Holdings Inc., making the timing and nature of this action particularly unfortunate for our user community.</p>

                        <p>StarPlayrX was conceived, designed, and developed with substantial input from visually impaired beta testers. The application's primary distinguishing feature was its enhanced accessibility framework, which provided superior navigation and content consumption capabilities compared to the official application.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="accessibility-features">
                            <li><strong>100% Voice Over Supported</strong> - Complete integration with Apple's VoiceOver technology throughout the entire app</li>
                            <li><strong>Stars/Favorites Support</strong> - Fully accessible favorites system with proper labeling for screen readers</li>
                            <li><strong>Channel Guide</strong> - Voice-navigable guide with comprehensive audio descriptions</li>
                            <li><strong>Categories</strong> - Accessible category navigation with semantic grouping</li>
                            <li><strong>Channels</strong> - Enhanced channel descriptions for non-visual users</li>
                            <li><strong>What's Playing</strong> - Real-time audio announcements of current content</li>
                            <li><strong>Magic Tap</strong> - Support for VoiceOver's Magic Tap gesture for quick access to common functions</li>
                            <li><strong>Play/Pause</strong> - Accessible media controls with proper labeling</li>
                            <li><strong>Siri Controls</strong> - Play and pause StarPlayrX directly using Siri commands</li>
                            <li><strong>Siri Volume</strong> - Adjust volume levels using voice commands through Siri</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>We contend that the removal of StarPlayrX represents a material reduction in the availability of accessible media consumption options for this demographic of SiriusXM subscribers.</p>

            <h2>Legal Information</h2>
            <div class="legal-content">
                <p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> StarPlayrX required a valid SiriusXM satellite radio subscription for operation, we maintain that no infringement of intellectual property or contractual rights occurred during the application's operational period.</p>
                
                <p><strong>FURTHERMORE:</strong> We note that SiriusXM Holdings Inc., the parent company that prompted this removal, permits third-party developers to create applications utilizing the Pandora API, a service also owned by SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p><strong>TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF REMOVAL:</strong> It has come to our attention that SiriusXM implemented a technical restriction specifically targeting StarPlayrX through user agent identification. This method involves server-side filtering that rejects API requests originating from the StarPlayrX application by examining the user agent string that identifies our software. This approach effectively disabled the application's functionality without requiring its removal from users' devices.</p>
                
                <p><strong>CONSEQUENTLY:</strong> The differential treatment between these platforms appears inconsistent with industry standards and potentially contrary to the interests of subscribers with accessibility requirements. The targeted technical measures implemented specifically against StarPlayrX demonstrate a calculated effort to restrict third-party accessibility solutions rather than a general security or compliance policy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE:</strong> In compliance with the received communication, StarPlayrX is no longer available for download, and existing installations may cease to function properly as server-side changes are implemented by SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>Users seeking alternative accessible media options are encouraged to communicate their accessibility requirements directly to SiriusXM Holdings Inc.</p>
                
                <p>The source code for StarPlayrX remains available for educational and research purposes via GitHub, in accordance with applicable fair use doctrines and for the advancement of accessibility technologies.</p>
